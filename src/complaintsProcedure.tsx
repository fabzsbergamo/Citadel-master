<p>We strive to ensure that there should be no time that you should have any cause for complaint in relation to the service we provide to you. In the unlikely event that you wish to raise a complaint or have any other concerns with regard to any service we have provided, you may submit a formal complaint. This procedure sets out the process that should be followed.</p>

<p>We will always attempt to resolve your complaint as quickly as possible. We will aim to do this within 72 hours following receipt of your complaint. If we are able to agree on a resolution with you within this time frame, then this may be communicated to you by telephone, letter, or email.</p>

<h2>Acknowledging Your Complaint</h2>

<p>There may be occasions when we need more time to resolve your complaint. If this is the case, we will send you a written or electronic acknowledgment of your complaint. This may include a request for more information to allow us to fully investigate your complaint.</p>

<h2>Investigating Your Complaint</h2>

<p>Your complaint will be reviewed and investigated by the firm’s Complaints Handler. Wherever possible, that person will not have been directly involved in the matter, which is the subject of the complaint, and will have the appropriate authority to discuss the complaint with you if necessary and to resolve the matter.</p>

<h2>Resolving Your Complaint</h2>

<p>We will endeavor to handle your complaint fairly and consistently and aim to provide a final written response at the earliest opportunity, but no longer than up to 56 days from the date of initial receipt.</p>

<p>If we are unable to resolve your complaint within 56 days, we will contact you and explain why we are not in a position to make a final written response and indicate when we expect to be in a position to provide one.</p>

<h2>Informing You of Our Decision</h2>

<p>The Complaint Handler will send you the firm’s ‘final written response’ to report on the findings of the investigation and confirm the outcome of your complaint.</p>

<p>The outcome of which, either:</p>

<ul>
    <li>accepts the complaint and, where appropriate, offers redress or remedial action (appropriate redress will not always involve financial redress); or,</li>
    <li>offers redress or remedial action without accepting the complaint; or,</li>
    <li>rejects the complaint and gives reasons for doing so, and which informs you that if you are not satisfied with our response then you may refer your complaint to Citizens Advice or your local Trading Standards by letter, email, or telephone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If You Are Not Satisfied with Our Response</h2>

<p>If you are dissatisfied with our final written response, you can refer your complaint to Trading Standards by contacting the Citizens Advice, or by contacting your local government department directly.</p>
